# Women And Web Literacy

Mozilla strives to build and support an equitable and inclusive online world for everyone. To do this, we want to challenge the existing gender imbalances that exist and create an online space where we can reach gender equality at scale.

We want to help shift the default to one where women have a strong, equitable role in reading, writing and participating on the web—and, ultimately, help lead the next wave of openness, innovation and opportunity online. **That’s why in 2016 Mozilla created a Mozilla Leadership Network Program focused on Women and Web Literacy.**

Mozilla’s Women and Web Literacy Program is a community of allies, executives, grassroots and young leaders who are actively advancing the principles of the open Internet by:

- Bringing women in technology
- Increasing Web Literacy
- Challenging gender equality and inclusion online
