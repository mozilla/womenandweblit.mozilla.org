Based on the success of the existing Mozilla Clubs program, Mozilla partnered with UN Women in 2016 to launch Mozilla Clubs for women and girls. The program was piloted in Cape Town and Nairobi where hundreds of all ages meet regularly in local community spaces and schools to learn how to read, write and participate on the web in inclusive and engaging ways. Mozilla now supports over 30 Mozilla Clubs for Women and Girls worldwide.

> I have learned how to teach women of everyday challenges that we face in our communities and give them skills to further grow Web Literacy.
