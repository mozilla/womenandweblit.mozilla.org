Based on the success of the existing Mozilla Clubs program, Mozilla partnered with UN Women in 2016 to launch Mozilla Clubs for women and girls. The program was piloted in Cape Town and Nairobi where hundreds of all ages meet regularly in local community spaces and schools to learn how to read, write and participate on the web in inclusive and engaging ways. Mozilla now supports over 30 Mozilla Clubs for Women and Girls worldwide.

> Through Mozilla clubs I aim to help end the gender technology gap and empower women and girls to create innovative solutions to advance equality in their communities.
